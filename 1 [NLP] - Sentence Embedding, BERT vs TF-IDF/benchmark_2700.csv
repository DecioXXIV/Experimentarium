rough time period here's a maxi pad it's actually disastrously bad for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpiã¨ce   'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard that hard everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like î¹ have got   well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew mcs get taken to school with this music 'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz

call me nascar nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's kryptonno asgard asgard   so you'll be thor and i'll be odin you rodent i'm omnipotent let off then i'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs i'm totin' and i should not be woken i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god;0;0;0;1

eminem came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin' but don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speakin' to children everything was happenin' so fast it was like i blinkedsold three million then it all went blank all i remember is feelin' ridiculous cause i was gettin' sick of this feelin' like i'm always under attack man i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin' women dishin' but really thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say it's just my opinion if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear end that's why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i'd just zone out good luck tryin' to convince a blonde it's like tellin' gwen stefani she sold out cause i was tryna leave no doubt in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now because everybody knows   skylar grey everybody knows that you're just an asshole everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice there's no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows everyone knows  interlude eminem thanks for the support asshole scratch thanks for the support asshole   eminem quit actin' salty i was countin' on you to count me out ask asher roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out thought i was history well goddamn honky that compliment's like backhandin' a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth nah i'm off him but what the fuck's all this trashtalkin' about the fight was fixed i'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me and now you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my beltword to pacquiao momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about better go in that ring and knock 'em out or you better not come out it's poetry in motion like freddie roach when he's quotin' shakespeare so what if insults are revoltin' even helen keller knows life stinks you think it's a joke 'til you're bulletriddled but you should give little shit what i think this whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a glock just to go watch batman who needs to test a testicles not that man half of you don't got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo my soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin' a black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole better pack toilet paper but i'm takin' no crap ho here i go down the bat pole and i'm changin' back into that old maniac in fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin' cause

can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows everyone knows   eminem holy mackerel i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull for thinkin' we had some magnetic pull then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin' magnets work cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable hate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical i'm makin' up words so you can understandable it's tragical thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen that ain't practical you crackin' a joke it's laughable cause me and love's like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable my heart is truly guarded full body armor bitch you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special you're retarded thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina you're a train wreck i got a onetrack mind shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor been tryna hunt me down like a dog cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent cause all of my spare time is spent on my nose in this binder so don't bother tryin' only women that i love are my daughters but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line it's apparent i shouldn't have been a parent i'll never grow up so to hell with your parents and motherfuck father time it ain't never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime so even if i'm halfdead i'm halfalive poured my halfempty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over and i'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster im goin' back to what got me here yeah cocky and cant knock bein' rude off so fear not my dear and dry up your teardrops i'm here white america's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird if you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too shouldn't be a shock because everybody knows

polarize shit so the thames might freeze and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah turn down for what i ain't loud enough nah turn the valium up illa illa illa 'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut now when it doesn't matter what caliber i spit at i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks you'll turn around and just be

it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even

'cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they've been puttin' me through the ringer so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners;0;0;0;1

other man  i stand in slapped by the wind as i begin do you know who i am and many reply with a grin yes i'm tired of being obtruded why should i be secluded i've got a brand new horn to be tooted to sum it up in a nutshell eminem will you kick it for me so i find myself in a certain obligatory a place that i dwell in fell into some wonderful productions to make up for lost time and then it brings obstruction finally let loose unloading the stockpile a mental projectile i aim at the reptile i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus is there a reason for this the hindrance is aggravating how many times will it take you before you realize you're fading fading from existence cause simulations are dead there's so much more to learn and pages left to be read so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor words can weigh a ton therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  scratched samples  yeah it's another  very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side but i see no borderline from under this colorblind and some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred but then i'm finally about to put an end to the hatred wrong the world would never endure to arguing awaking to the absence of unity is startling oh foolish pride what the hell are you trying to do you cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable you're graceless bland you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless damn you're dull it's time you faced this here taste this straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles the date of my birth on the earth the deliverance of a starchild blessed with formidable talent and versatility but with such a power there comes a responsibilty to infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear to form an alliance is something even the giants fear so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend  scratched samples  yeah it's another  eminem  you know i don't understand why we all just can't get along you hate me but you know me and what i stand for no so then why do you speak for me and every other white man when you that we're your enemy  on the floor lies a broken door cause i'm not to be spoken for stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore rarely do you see the lighter side of me i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry but  is isolated apologies are exhausted feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted switch to the opposite now scenes are being reenacted pull up that boy by his roots destroy him quick his fracture's obviating we hate him his patterns past us huh always fighting for the position of top dog that spot's already occupied and i don't play leapfrog cause i do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine but i'm always having to prove myself time after time oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast judged from the past and he's put last and others with nothing to say stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like danny kaye here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please i've got a craving;0;0;0;1
